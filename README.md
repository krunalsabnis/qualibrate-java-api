# Qaulibrate API 2.0

This is a Demo Microservice REST APIs written in Java 8 using Spring Boot.
It tries to follow API maturity model Level 3 using Swagger and asciidoc for API documentation.
Integration test using JUnit and H2DB for "test" profile. (No Mocks !)

CI/CD : Using Travis for CI/CD : (Currently it runs only builds on every commit and merge.)

## Minimum Prerequisites

* Java 8 SDK

## Build

Build process includes,
* Test Cases
* StyleCheck (in process)
* Code Quality Check (in process)
* asciidoc doc job to generate API documentation

There are two ways you can build the project.
Both are one command build only.

1. once you clone this repository, in project root folder execute below command.

```
> ./gradlew build
```
Note : For Windows environment asciidoc sometimes gives warning (due to a bug with Ruby)
and shows that build is failed which is really not.
Hence, i recommend to use second approach below

2. User Docker as Build machine.
This app needs Java 8 to build and JRE 8 for runtime. I have created this simple docker build machine based on Official Java 8 image.

If you have docker installed then execute below command.
There are two parameters to specify. 
1. Git URL : in this case its same as this repository's URL
2. Docker's path for mounted volume. so make sure you mount a volume and specify the path

```
docker run --name {name-for-your-container} -e GIT_REPO_URL='https://github.com/krunalsabnis/qualibrate-java-api.git' -e DOCKER_PATH='{path-on-container-filesystem where git will clone and gradle build is run}' -i -v {your-local-dir}:{path-on-container-filesystem} krunalsabnis/spring-java-build:latest
```

[You can retrigger build many time for any project.For more details Please refer  https://hub.docker.com/r/krunalsabnis/spring-java-build/]



## Run

To Run the project run the following command:

1. Run as standalone spring-boot application
```
> ./gradlew bootRun
OR
> java -jar build/libs/qualibrate-java-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```



2. Docker Compose for [MySQL, Spring Boot App, nginx]
runs with "dev" profile and It brings three containers up.
 a. MySQL instance
 b. Spring Boot app instance
 c. nginx for static content - as of now it hosts API documentation generated by asciidoc

 In case of "dev" profile also dummy data is loaded but in MySQL and not in H2DB as in case of "test"
  
    


```
> docker-compose up
```
## Once containers are up you can access APIs as below

# API Base URL 	:  http://localhost:8080
# Swagger Page	:  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
# API Documents	:  http://localhost:8085
